# ActionFeatureExtractor
Scripts for using SlowFast/I3D network to extract features from your own videos. The scripts are from the tutorials of [Gluon](https://cv.gluon.ai/build/examples_action_recognition/feat_custom.html) and with little adjustment.
I'm fresh to the Gluon and just want to use it to extract features in my project. The shared codes might contain bugs.
